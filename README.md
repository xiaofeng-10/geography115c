## satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity
- Gathered remote sensing data related to fire and pre-processed large amounts of raw data, including cropping and masking with QGIS, using R to process spatial data, reproject coordinates, and resample to match resolution.
- Built linear regression models to analyze the relationship between NBR, NDVI, BAI, and fire severity across study areas.
- Evaluated the performance of flammability indices to assess their ability in predicting fire severity, identifying NBR as the best predictor among the three.

## lab_3: Remote Sensing and GIS Integration in R
Imported shapefiles into R and used them to analyze different parts of an image. Applied skills such as extracting values from regions of interest and analyzing these values using mathematical and statistical functions

## lab_4: Time Series Analysis in R
Performed time series analysis to examine how wildfires change over time, specifically monitoring the change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values at a given location, revealing the magnitude of disturbance and the duration required for an ecosystem to return to its pre-disturbance state

## lab_5: Pre-processing and Classifying Imagery in R
Pre-processed remote sensing images, involving extensive data cleaning and wrangling. For example, reprojected geospatial data and masked and cropped images using polygons.

P.S. The data for 'satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity' and 'lab_5' are too large to upload. The data for 'satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity' alone is more than 2 GB. Please reach out if you are interested in seeing the data :)
