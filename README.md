## lab_3: Remote Sensing and GIS Integration in R
Imported shapefiles into R and used them to analyze different parts of an image. Applied skills such as extracting values from regions of interest and analyzing these values using mathematical and statistical functions

## lab_4: Time Series Analysis in R
Performed time series analysis to examine how wildfires change over time, specifically monitoring the change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values at a given location, revealing the magnitude of disturbance and the duration required for an ecosystem to return to its pre-disturbance state

## lab_5: Pre-processing and Classifying Imagery in R
Pre-processed remote sensing images, involving extensive data cleaning and wrangling. For example, reprojected geospatial data and masked and cropped images using polygons.
