## satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity
- Gathered remote sensing data related to fire, and pre-processed raw data needed to calculate NBR, NDVI, and BAI
- Separated the four study areas, cropped and masked raw data with QGIS, used R to process spatial data, reproject coordinate, and resample to match resolution
- Built a linear regression models to analyze the relationship between NBR, NDVI, BAI, and fire severity for each study areas
- Analyzed the generated images and compare the performance of different flammability indices across the study areas to assess their ability to express fire severity

## lab_3: Remote Sensing and GIS Integration in R
Imported shapefiles into R and used them to analyze different parts of an image. Applied skills such as extracting values from regions of interest and analyzing these values using mathematical and statistical functions

## lab_4: Time Series Analysis in R
Performed time series analysis to examine how wildfires change over time, specifically monitoring the change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values at a given location, revealing the magnitude of disturbance and the duration required for an ecosystem to return to its pre-disturbance state

## lab_5: Pre-processing and Classifying Imagery in R
Pre-processed remote sensing images, involving extensive data cleaning and wrangling. For example, reprojected geospatial data and masked and cropped images using polygons.

P.S. The data for 'satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity' and 'lab_5' are too large to upload. The data for 'satellite_imagery_on_predicting_burn_severity' alone is more than 2 GB. Please reach out if you are interested in seeing the data :)
